<h1>Homework 1 - Map Reduce Jobs</h1>

<h2>Submission by: Sasanka Mouli Subrahmanya Sri Veleti</h2>

<h2>Objective of the Project</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px">To generate various statistics related to log files by leveraging Hadoop Map-Reduce Framework, namely the following 4 tasks </p>
<ol style="font-size: 18px">
<li>To show the distribution of different types of messages across predefined time intervals and injected string instances of the designated regex pattern for these log message types</li>
<li>To compute time intervals sorted in the descending order that contained most log messages of the type ERROR with injected regex pattern string instances</li>
<li>And for each message type you will produce the number of the generated log messages</li>
<li>To produce the number of characters in each log message for each log message type that contain the highest number of characters in the detected instances of the designated regex pattern</li>
</ol>
